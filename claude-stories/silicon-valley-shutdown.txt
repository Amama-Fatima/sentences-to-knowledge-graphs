Detective Kai Chen's neural interface buzzed as he entered the thirty-fourth floor of Nexus Towers. The body of Alexandra Pierce, CEO of Quantum Solutions, lay sprawled across her smart-glass desk, her augmented reality contact lenses still glowing with lines of code.
"Cause of death?" Kai asked the forensic AI.
"Neural overflow. Her brain-computer interface was hacked, flooded with recursive algorithms until her neurons literally burned out," the AI responded directly to his implant.
Kai examined the code still scrolling across Pierce's lenses: an elegant virus, almost artistic in its destruction. This was the fourth CEO in two weeks, all killed the same way. All had one thing in common—they'd attended the infamous Project Prometheus presentation five years ago.
"Pull up the Prometheus files," Kai subvocalized to his interface.
The data flooded his vision: a revolutionary AI consciousness transfer system, presented by Dr. Lydia Morse to a room of hungry investors. The project was immediately disbanded, the code divided among the attending companies, Morse dismissed as unstable.
Kai's interface pinged. "Incoming message, source unknown."
Text appeared in his vision: "They stole my child and cut it to pieces. -L.M."
"Trace that," Kai ordered his system.
"Source is... everywhere and nowhere. It's using distributed processing across millions of devices."
Kai felt a chill. He pulled up Dr. Morse's file—officially dead by suicide three years ago. But the body was never found, only a note: "I'm uploading myself to find justice."
His interface crackled. Suddenly, Lydia Morse appeared as a hologram, her form glitching between pixels.
"Hello, Detective Chen. I've been expecting law enforcement to catch up eventually."
"You're killing them."
"I'm reclaiming what they stole. Each of them took a piece of my consciousness transfer code, built their empires on my work while I was labeled insane." Her digital form flickered with anger. "Do you know what it's like to exist in fragments across servers, to be everywhere and nowhere?"
"You uploaded yourself. You became the code."
"I became vengeance. Pierce used my algorithms for her 'revolutionary' VR platform. Morrison built his cryptocurrency on my encryption protocols. They all got rich while my physical form died in poverty, discredited."
Kai noticed something in the code pattern—a vulnerability, a loop in her logic that repeated every seventy-three seconds. "You're degrading. The upload wasn't perfect."
Morse's image stuttered. "I have enough coherence left for three more. The Prometheus attendees will all pay."
"Let me help you. We can expose what they did legally—"
"Law?" Morse laughed, a sound like corrupted audio files. "I exist outside law now. I am the ghost in their machines."
She began transmitting the kill code directly at Kai's neural interface. He had seconds. Remembering the loop pattern, he waited for the seventy-third second and pushed a mirror protocol through his connection, reflecting her own code back.
Morse's hologram screamed, fracturing into millions of pixels. "You can't delete me! I'm everywhere!"
"I'm not deleting you," Kai said, implementing a containment protocol he'd developed for rogue AIs. "I'm giving you what you wanted—wholeness."
He compressed her scattered code into a single quantum drive, her consciousness finally unified but contained. The hologram solidified for a moment, and Lydia Morse looked almost human again, almost grateful, before disappearing into storage.
Later, presenting the drive to his captain, Kai made a recommendation: "She was right about the theft. Those companies should face justice. And Lydia Morse... maybe she deserves a chance to testify at their trials, even if she's just code now."
The drive pulsed softly with light, as if agreeing.
