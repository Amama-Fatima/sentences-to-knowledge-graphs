The pachinko parlor's lights strobed across Kenji Nakamura's face as he inserted the USB drive. In three seconds, seventeen million dollars in cryptocurrency would vanish from the Yamada clan's digital wallet. In four seconds, he'd be the richest dead man in Tokyo.
The screen flashed: TRANSFER COMPLETE.
Then the lights went out.
A blade whispered through air. Nakamura's scream became a gurgle.

Detective Inspector James Song descended into the maintenance tunnels beneath Neo-Tokyo's gaming district, where condensation from above created an endless neon rain. His years running security at Macau's largest casino had taught him that where gambling thrived, darker economies followed.
"Victim was a crypto specialist," Officer Tanaka explained, leading him through the maze. "Found him at a terminal in this abandoned server farm. But James... look at his arms."
Track marks. Fresh ones. And something else—QR codes tattooed on his wrists, the ink still raised.
Song scanned them with his phone. Each opened a different crypto wallet, all empty except for transaction histories showing massive transfers to addresses registered in Myanmar, Cambodia, Vietnam.
"Human trafficking routes," Song muttered. His casino days had shown him these patterns—money flowing to flesh markets.
The server farm told a story: hundreds of machines mining cryptocurrency, but also something else. Facial recognition databases. Immigration photos. Missing persons reports from across Southeast Asia.
"They're using the crypto to buy people," Tanaka said, horrified.
"No," Song corrected, studying the code on Nakamura's screen. "They're using people to mine crypto. Living batteries."
A woman's sob echoed through the tunnels.
Following the sound, they found her—Lin Wei, nineteen, Shanghai ID, chained to a mining rig. Electrodes on her temples, using her brain's processing power to solve blockchain equations. Around her, dozens of empty stations, recently evacuated.
"He saved us," she whispered in Mandarin. "The one they killed. He changed the wallets, freed the money."
Song's investigation accelerated. Nakamura wasn't stealing—he was liberating. The cryptocurrency funded a trafficking ring that literally used humans as computing power, their neural electricity harvesting digital coins while their bodies wasted away.
The Yamada clan connection seemed obvious until Song found the real pattern. Three other yakuza families had been hit the same night, all their crypto stolen. Someone was playing the clans against each other while running the real operation.
His phone buzzed. Casino facial recognition had matched someone from the tunnels—Thomas Richter, former MIT neuroscientist, now working for TechnoGlobe Corp, the company that maintained the gaming district's digital infrastructure.
Song confronted Richter at TechnoGlobe's office, forty floors above the neon maze. The man didn't run. Didn't deny.
"Do you understand the elegance?" Richter asked. "Human brains process certain calculations faster than machines. We're not trafficking people—we're optimizing them."
"You're enslaving them."
"The yakuza were going to kill them anyway. At least this way, they produce value."
The conversation turned violent when Song revealed Lin Wei had identified Richter. The scientist pulled a pistol—the same one that killed Nakamura, ballistics would later confirm. The fight ranged through the server room, Song using his casino-honed skills at reading micro-expressions to anticipate Richter's moves.
But the real twist came when Song accessed Richter's terminal. The scientist wasn't the mastermind—he was middle management. The operation traced back to a coalition of legitimate tech companies, using yakuza violence as cover while they tested human-computer integration.
Song secured the evidence, arrested Richter, but knew the victory was hollow. Forty-three people remained missing from the empty stations. The crypto wallets Nakamura had emptied were already being refilled from new sources.
That night, Song stood in the neon rain of the tunnels, watching forensics teams catalogue the horror. His casino years had taught him the house always wins. But down here, he wasn't sure who the house was anymore.
Lin Wei was safe. That had to count for something.
Above, the pachinko parlors rang with artificial joy, while below, the neon continued to bleed through the storm drains, painting everything in electric shades of moral grey.
The game continued. Song would play another hand tomorrow.
