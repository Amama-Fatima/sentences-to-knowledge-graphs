Detective Emma Walsh cursed under her breath as her snowshoes crunched through the pristine Canadian wilderness. Three feet of fresh powder made every step an effort, and the temperature had dropped to minus twenty Celsius. She'd rather be investigating fraud from her warm office in Calgary, but this case demanded she follow the tracks—literal ones.
"There, Detective!" Dr. James Kowalski, the wildlife veterinarian, pointed toward a grove of pine trees. "That's where we found what was left of the camping equipment."
The scene looked like something from a horror movie. A mangled tent, scattered belongings, and dark stains in the snow painted a picture of a vicious animal attack. But Emma had investigated enough insurance fraud to know that dramatic scenes often told the biggest lies.
"Mr. Peterson claimed a grizzly bear destroyed his campsite and nearly killed him?" Emma asked, photographing the evidence.
"That's his story. Wants to claim fifty thousand dollars for medical expenses, lost equipment, and trauma counseling."
Emma knelt beside the tent remains. "Dr. Kowalski, what do you make of these tears?"
The veterinarian examined the fabric carefully. "Well, they're certainly dramatic, but..." He frowned. "These edges are too clean. Bear claws would create more ragged tears, and there would be pulling damage where the bear grabbed and shook the material."
"What about the blood?"
"Human blood, confirmed. But the spatter pattern is wrong. It's too evenly distributed. Real bear attacks create chaotic blood patterns—arterial spraying, impact spatters. This looks almost... painted on."
Emma's radio crackled. Her partner's voice cut through the static: "Walsh, I've got Peterson's medical records. His injuries are consistent with defensive wounds, but they're all on his arms and hands. No damage to his torso or legs."
"That's odd for a bear attack," Dr. Kowalski observed. "Bears typically go for the body mass first."
They hiked deeper into the woods, following the trail of disturbed snow. Emma's trained eye caught inconsistencies—boot prints that seemed to double back, broken branches that looked deliberately snapped rather than damaged by a large animal.
"Detective!" A voice called from behind them. A burly man in his forties approached on cross-country skis, his face flushed from cold and exertion. "Rick Peterson. I heard you were investigating my case."
Emma studied him carefully. His left arm was in a sling, and she could see bandages peeking out from his jacket sleeves. "Mr. Peterson. We're examining the attack site."
"Terrible experience. That bear came out of nowhere. I barely escaped with my life."
"Tell me exactly what happened."
Peterson launched into a dramatic recounting—the sudden appearance of a massive grizzly, the desperate fight for survival, his heroic escape through the wilderness. But something nagged at Emma.
"Mr. Peterson, you said the bear attacked at dawn?"
"Yes, just as I was making coffee."
"But grizzlies are hibernating this time of year. They shouldn't be active in these conditions."
Peterson's confident demeanor faltered slightly. "Well, maybe it wasn't a grizzly. Could have been a black bear, or maybe the warm weather woke it up early."
Dr. Kowalski shook his head. "The temperature hasn't been above freezing in two months."
Emma's radio buzzed again. "Walsh, Peterson filed three other animal attack claims in the past five years. Wolf attack in British Columbia, mountain lion in Alberta, and a moose incident in Saskatchewan. All for similar amounts, all paid out."
Emma looked Peterson straight in the eye. "Mr. Peterson, we found something interesting back at your campsite. Dog tracks. Large ones, probably a German Shepherd or similar breed."
Peterson went pale. "I... I don't know anything about dogs."
"We also found this." Emma pulled out an evidence bag containing a dog collar with metal studs. "Hidden under your tent floor. The studs match the puncture patterns on your arms perfectly."
The fight went out of Peterson like air from a punctured tire. "My brother's dog. I trained it to attack on command. I never meant for anyone to get hurt—just needed the money for my daughter's surgery."
As they escorted Peterson back through the snow, Emma reflected on how desperation could drive people to elaborate deceptions. Even in the vast honesty of the wilderness, lies had a way of leaving tracks.
