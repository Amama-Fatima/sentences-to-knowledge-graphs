The crime scene was one of horticultural horror. Agatha Page adjusted her wide-brimmed sun hat and peered through her magnifying glass at the severed stem. It was a clean cut, surgical almost.

"His name was Zeke," wailed Betty Miller, clutching her floral apron to her heart. "He was going to win the county fair! Look at the size of that stump! He was a champion!"

Around them, the Sunnydale Community Garden buzzed with more excitement than a sale on orthopedic shoes. The theft of Betty's prize zucchini was the crime of the decade in their small town.

"Now, now, Betty, we'll get to the root of this," Agatha said calmly. Her career as a head librarian had trained her for this: quiet observation, knowledge of everyone's business, and a deep understanding of human nature. "Who else knew about Zeke?"

"Everyone!" Betty cried. "Old Man Henderson said his tomatoes were better, but they're pathetic! And Susan from the bakery asked for the first slice for her famous zucchini bread. She was awfully keen."

Agatha made a mental note. Motive: jealousy and culinary ambition. She examined the soil around the plant. Among the mulch and boot prints—everyone had trampled the scene—was a single, vibrant pink sequin, glittering in the sun.

"Interesting," Agatha murmured.

She first visited Old Man Henderson's plot. His tomatoes were, indeed, pathetic. He was spraying them with a foul-smelling homemade concoction. "Serves her right," he grumbled. "Bragging about that green monster. A vegetable shouldn't need its own zip code." His boots were caked in mud, but clean of sequins.

Next was the Sunnydale Bakery. The air was sweet with the scent of cinnamon and yeast. Susan, a woman dusted in a permanent layer of flour, was cheerful.

"Oh, poor Betty!" she said, sliding a fresh scone across the counter to Agatha. "I was so looking forward to making that bread. My signature loaf! I even bought new, sparkly oven mitts for the occasion." She gestured to a pair of hot pink, sequined mitts hanging by the oven. The sequins were a perfect match.

A clue! But Susan seemed genuinely disappointed, not guilty.

"Did you visit the garden this morning?" Agatha asked.

"Oh, yes! I went to admire Zeke and confirm the measurements for my recipe. I wore my new mitts to put my hands around him—for scale, you know? For a photo! I must have dropped a sequin then."

Another dead end. Or was it? Agatha thanked her and took her scone outside. She sat on a bench, thinking. The sequin was from a morning visit, but the theft happened in the afternoon. The real clue wasn't the sequin itself, but where it was found: right at the base of the stem, pressed into the soil. It must have fallen during the theft.

Someone had been wearing something pink and sequined that afternoon. But who?

Then she saw him. Barry, the owner of the local health food store, was walking his tiny, yapping dog. The dog, a prancing Pomeranian named Pixie, was wearing a new, hideous hot pink sweater—covered in sequins.

Agatha approached with a smile. "Hello, Barry. Lovely sweater on Pixie."

"Isn't it?" he beamed. "Just bought it today."

"Did you take her for a walk in the community garden this afternoon? The soil is so rich there, wonderful for the senses."

"Oh yes! We stopped by so she could... you know, do her business. Right near Betty's plot. Why?"

Agatha didn't answer. She was looking at Pixie's paws. Clinging to the sequined sweater, almost invisible, was a tiny shred of green, fleshy plant matter. Zucchini skin.

"Barry," Agatha said, her voice losing its gentle tone. "I think you and Pixie need to come with me. I believe you let your dog 'do her business' on the evidence. And then, to hide the desecration, you cut the entire zucchini off and took it home. You didn't want to win the fair. You just wanted to clean up after your dog."

Barry's face fell. The case was solved. It wasn't malice, but mere mortification—and a very bad decision.
