The syringe slid between Emma's ribs like a whisper, injecting her with something that made her bones feel like they were growing backwards. At seven years old, she didn't understand why the man in the rabbit costume was doing this, only that her skin was starting to split.
Around her, five other children writhed in similar agony, their bodies transforming into something monstrous.

Detective Specialist Viktor Cross moved through Wonderland's abandoned main street, where carousel music played backwards on broken speakers. His military background had prepared him for horror, but the small sneaker filled with blood—still warm—tested even his limits.
"Six children missing in two weeks," Officer Dawn said, her voice tight. "All taken from their beds, no sign of struggle."
Viktor examined the sneaker. Inside, a note written in what looked like bile: "The white rabbit knows the way down."
Following a trail of similar cryptic clues, they found the entrance—a maintenance tunnel beneath the park's centerpiece, a massive Alice in Wonderland statue whose face had rotted into a perpetual scream.
The tunnel led to Wonderland's original bomb shelter, built during the Cold War. Inside, Viktor discovered a makeshift laboratory. Children's drawings covered one wall—stick figures with too many limbs, bodies shaped wrong. On the surgical tables, biological samples that made Officer Dawn vomit.
"Bio-weapons," Viktor said, recognizing the setup. "Someone's using the children as incubators."
A giggle echoed from deeper in the complex. Child-like but wrong.
They found her in the testing chamber—Dr. Lisa Chen, renowned geneticist, wearing a rotting Mad Hatter costume. Around her, six children in various stages of transformation. Their bones had grown through their skin in places, creating external armor. Their eyes had multiplied. One boy had fingers that had fused into claws.
"Detective Cross!" Chen clapped. "You're just in time for tea!"
Viktor kept his weapon trained on her while Dawn called for backup. "Let the children go."
"Go? They're perfect now! Evolution in fast-forward. My own little weapons against a cruel world." Chen's eyes were wild. "Do you know what the military does with bio-weapons, Detective? I do. I created them for fifteen years."
"You're Viktor Cross," the transformed boy suddenly spoke, his voice layered like multiple children speaking at once. "You interrogated my father in Afghanistan. Made him confess to things he didn't do."
Viktor's blood froze. He recognized those eyes—Ahmad Rashid's son.
Chen laughed. "Surprise! Every child here? Their parents were your victims, Detective. The people you broke with your 'enhanced interrogation.' I tracked them down, gave them a gift—transformation into something that could fight back."
"You're insane."
"Am I? You created monsters with your torture. I'm just making them literal."
The children began moving, surrounding Viktor and Dawn with inhuman coordination. Their transformed bodies were weapons—bone spurs, acidic saliva, elongated limbs with too many joints.
"Here's the beautiful part," Chen continued. "The pathogen is airborne now. These children are carriers. Every breath they take releases spores. The entire city will transform within weeks."
Viktor's mind raced. His interrogation skills kicked in—Chen was lying about something. The transformed children weren't attacking, just surrounding them. Why?
Then he understood. "You're not Dr. Chen."
The woman's face twitched. "What?"
"Chen died two years ago. Cancer. You're someone else. Someone I know."
The mask slipped—literally. Latex peeled away revealing Captain Monica Reeves, his former military commander who'd been court-martialed for authorizing his interrogations.
"You always were too smart, Viktor." She pulled a detonator. "The shelter's rigged. We all die together—you, me, and your victims' children. Poetic justice."
Viktor shot her hand, sending the detonator flying. But the children screamed in unison, their transformation accelerating. Whatever she'd done to them was reaching critical mass.
"The antidote!" Dawn spotted syringes in a case. "There has to be one!"
Viktor grabbed them, but there were only three doses. Six children.
"Choose," Reeves laughed through her pain. "Just like you chose who to break in those cells."
Viktor made the only choice he could. He injected three children, then turned the gun on himself. "Dawn, get them out. Call CDC. Full contamination protocol."
"Viktor, no—"
"I'm already infected. Look." His hand was beginning to transform, skin bubbling. "I was the real weapon. She made me patient zero. Every person I've touched in the last week..."
The evacuation was chaos. Three children saved, three transformed beyond recovery. Viktor Cross quarantined himself in the shelter with Reeves and the infected children, waiting for the CDC burn team.
His last report, carved into the wall with transformed claws: "The real virus was always guilt. She just made it contagious."
Wonderland was sterilized with fire. But somewhere in the city, people Viktor had touched were beginning to change.
