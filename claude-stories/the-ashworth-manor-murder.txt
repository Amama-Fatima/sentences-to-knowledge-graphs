The grand ballroom of Ashworth Manor was a frozen tableau of elegance and alarm. In the center, Lord Ashworth lay dead on the Persian rug, a half-empty champagne flute clutched in his hand. His face was a mask of silent agony.

Inspector Percival Finch, a man built of tweed and meticulous observation, surveyed the scene. The guests—a glittering array of flappers, tycoons, and old-money aristocracy—huddled together, their whispers like the rustle of fallen leaves.

“Cyanide, I’d wager,” murmured Dr. Lowell, rising from the body. “Quick. Brutal. In the champagne.”

The butler, a man so rigid he seemed carved from oak, presented the tray. “The glass was from his lordship’s private stock, Inspector. He alone drank from that bottle tonight. I poured it myself.”

“And who delivered it to him?” Finch asked, his voice quiet.

“I did,” came a trembling voice. It was Lady Ashworth, a beautiful woman with eyes red from crying. “It was a toast to our anniversary.” Her statement was met with a few sympathetic murmurs, but Finch’s eye caught the way her new, young Italian chauffeur watched her from the doorway—not with concern, but with keen interest.

Finch’s sergeant was checking alibis. “Everyone was in the room, sir. No one approached Lord Ashworth after his wife gave him the glass.”

The clue wasn’t in who was present, but in what was absent. Finch’s eyes scanned the lord’s person. His watch, his signet ring… but his silver cigarette case, a constant companion, was missing from his waistcoat pocket.

“His cigarette case,” Finch said to the butler. “Did he have it tonight?”

“I… I cannot say, Inspector.”

Finch’s attention turned to the fireplace. Among the pristine ashes, something gleamed. Using tweezers, he retrieved it—a small, melted lump of silver and enamel. The remains of the cigarette case.

“Why destroy it?” the sergeant pondered.

“Not destroy,” Finch corrected. “Dispose of the evidence it contained.” He turned to the guests. “The poison wasn’t in the champagne. It was on the lord’s own cigarettes. He toasted his wife, then he took a smoke. The culprit didn’t need to approach him after the toast. They had already tampered with the cigarettes hours before.”

His gaze swept the room, landing on the one person who had both the knowledge and the opportunity. Not the wife, who was too obvious. Not the chauffeur, who lacked access.

He stopped before Mr. Edwards, Lord Ashworth’s nervous, bird-like business partner. “You were seen arguing with his lordship this afternoon, Mr. Edwards. Over significant financial losses he had discovered that you tried to hide. Losses that would ruin you.”

Edwards paled. “That’s… that’s conjecture!”

“Is it?” Finch held up the melted lump. “The killer needed to dispose of the remaining poisoned cigarettes after Ashworth collapsed. But only someone who knew the house intimately would know the fire in the grand ballroom is never lit during a summer party. It was the one place to dispose of something without being seen going outside. You’ve been a guest here for twenty years. You knew.”

Edwards’s shoulders slumped, the fight draining out of him. The case, much like the cigarette in the fireplace, was closed.
