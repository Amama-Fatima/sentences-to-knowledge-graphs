The smell hit Detective Vera Castillo before she even entered the Grandview Puppet Theater—decay mixed with sawdust and something sickeningly sweet. Twenty years abandoned, the theater's marquee hung crooked, advertising a show that never ended: "Pinocchio's Last Dance."
"Third body's upstairs," Officer Chen said, his face pale. "Same as the others."
Vera climbed the rotting stairs, each step groaning beneath her weight. In the rehearsal room, she found him—Marcus Webb, renowned puppeteer, suspended from the rafters by piano wire. His limbs were posed grotesquely, joints bent at impossible angles, wooden dowels inserted beneath the skin to hold the position.
"Someone's turning them into puppets," Chen whispered.
Vera examined the body. The killer had carved delicate hinges into Webb's joints, painted his face white with red circles on the cheeks. A calling card lay pinned to his chest: "The strings remember."
"Get me everything on the other victims," Vera ordered. "Sarah Mills and James Torrent. All three worked here?"
"Twenty-five years ago. They performed together—some experimental show that ended badly. Theater closed right after."
Vera wandered the stage, her flashlight cutting through darkness. Hundreds of marionettes hung from the flies, their glass eyes catching the light. One puppet stood apart—larger, more elaborate, dressed like a ringmaster. Its face was human-like, disturbingly so.
"That's Maestro Giovanni," a voice said from the shadows.
Vera spun, hand on her weapon. A gaunt man emerged, his fingers twitching rhythmically as if pulling invisible strings.
"Tommy Ashford," he said. "I maintain the building. Or try to."
"You knew the victims?"
Tommy's fingers danced faster. "They killed him, you know. Giovanni. Not the puppet—the man who created it. Vincent Giovanni. They said his methods were too extreme, too dangerous. They sabotaged his final show, and he died in the rigging accident."
Vera studied Tommy's movements—the precise way his fingers moved, the slight tilt of his head. "You were here that night."
"I was twelve. Vincent was teaching me. He said puppets have souls, that the strings connect us to something ancient." Tommy's eyes glazed. "After he died, Maestro Giovanni started speaking to me."
"The puppet speaks to you?"
"He tells me who pulled the strings that night. Who cut the wrong rope. Who let him fall." Tommy's voice changed, became deeper, theatrical. "Sarah held the spotlight that blinded him. James checked the rigging but ignored the frayed cable. Marcus gave the signal to raise him, knowing..."
"Tommy," Vera said carefully, "you killed them."
"No!" Tommy's fingers went wild. "Maestro Giovanni moves through me. I'm just the vessel, like wood and string!"
He lunged, producing a thin wire from his sleeve. Vera sidestepped, her training taking over. They struggled among the hanging marionettes, wooden bodies clattering around them. Tommy moved with unnatural grace, as if pulled by invisible strings, but Vera managed to pin him.
As backup arrived, Tommy laughed, a broken sound. "You can arrest the puppet, Detective, but the puppeteer remains free. Giovanni's still up there, in the flies, waiting for his next performance."
Vera looked up at the elaborate marionette of Maestro Giovanni. For just a moment, in the shifting shadows, she could have sworn she saw its fingers twitch.
Later, reviewing the case files, she found an old program from Giovanni's final show. The photo showed Vincent Giovanni—his face identical to the ringmaster puppet that watched over his twisted revenge.
