Lord Pemberton's blood pooled beneath the Caravaggio, mixing with oils that shouldn't exist—vermillion made from cinnabar, a pigment banned since 1849. His killer had painted over his wounds, turning his corpse into a grotesque masterpiece that mirrored the painting above: "Judith Beheading Holofernes."
The brushwork was exquisite. The murder, even more so.

Detective Inspector Catherine Vale crouched beside Pemberton's body, her curator's eye catching what others missed. "This isn't just murder. It's attribution."
"Attribution?" Sergeant Mills asked.
"The killer's signing their work. See these brushstrokes? They match Alessandro Torretti, Venice, 1892. But Torretti never painted murders—he was infamous for something else entirely."
Catherine's investigation led her through Pemberton's collection. Every painting was genuine except one—a Vermeer that sang with wrongness. X-ray analysis revealed another painting beneath, and another beneath that, seven layers deep like Russian dolls. Each layer dated to a different theft: 1924, 1897, 1871, always from the same family.
"The Blackwood Collection," she breathed. "These were all stolen from the Blackwoods over a century."
The pattern emerged: three dead collectors in two weeks, each murdered to match a painting they owned, each holding stolen Blackwood pieces. The killer wasn't just seeking revenge—they were reclaiming a birthright.
Catherine descended into the smuggling tunnels beneath Mayfair, following traces of cinnabar that glowed under blacklight. The tunnels connected seven estates, all built by Victorian merchant families who'd grown rich during the Empire's peak. The Blackwoods had been different—artists and scholars who'd assembled Britain's finest private collection before mysteriously losing everything in 1871.
In the tunnels, she found a workshop. Canvases stretched like skins, pigments ground from minerals that shouldn't exist, and journals detailing five generations of theft. The entries began in faded Victorian script and ended in fresh ink: "They stole our legacy painting by painting. I'm taking it back corpse by corpse."
"Magnificent, isn't it?"
Catherine turned. Margaret Blackwood-Torretti stood in the doorway, her clothes splattered with paint and blood. At seventy-three, she moved with an artist's grace.
"You're Torretti's descendant," Catherine said.
"Great-great-granddaughter. He married Isabella Blackwood in secret. The other families destroyed them for it—an Italian painter sullying British blood. They carved up our collection like vultures, claimed we'd sold it to cover debts." Margaret's eyes burned. "Every generation since has been recovering our inheritance. I'm simply the first to demand interest."
"Interest?"
"Their lives, Inspector. Painted in the style of what they stole. Pemberton's Caravaggio? My family commissioned it in 1603. The Hendersons' Rembrandt? A gift from the artist himself." She gestured to fresh canvases. "Four more families to go."
Catherine noticed something crucial: the workshop held forgeries of every stolen painting, perfect reproductions. "You've been replacing them. The murders aren't just revenge—they're distractions."
Margaret smiled. "Hundred and fifty years of thefts, reversed in a fortnight. While everyone investigates the murders, I'm swapping every stolen Blackwood piece with a forgery. The families will own nothing but lies, just like they left us."
"Except you're using mercury-based vermillion. It's toxic. You're dying."
"Two months left, the doctors say. Mercury poisoning from years of grinding pigments like my ancestors." Margaret raised a brush loaded with the deadly red. "Enough time to finish my masterpiece."
The confrontation was swift. Catherine, knowing Margaret's criminal profile, had anticipated her final move—not violence, but art. Margaret threw the vermillion powder, creating a toxic cloud. But Catherine had come prepared with a respirator, tackling the elderly woman before she could escape into the tunnels.
As backup arrived, Margaret laughed. "Check their collections, Inspector. Check them all."
They did. Every stolen Blackwood painting in London had been replaced with forgeries so perfect that only chemical analysis could detect them. The originals were found in a climate-controlled vault beneath the Blackwood ruins, returned home after five generations.
At trial, Margaret revealed her final twist: she'd documented everything, including proof that London's elite families had built their fortunes on theft. The scandal destroyed dynasties.
"Was it worth it?" Catherine asked during her final interview.
Margaret smiled, mercury tremors shaking her hands. "I painted them into history as thieves and murderers. That's an attribution that will last forever."
