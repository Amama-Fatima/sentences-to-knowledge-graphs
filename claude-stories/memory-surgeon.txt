The drill bit entered Thomas Crane's skull with the precision of a Swiss watch, each rotation calculated to preserve the hippocampus while destroying everything else. He was awake—had to be for the memory extraction to work properly. His screams echoed through Ward C until they didn't.
The surgeon hummed Chopin's Funeral March, watching memories dance across the neural scanner like dying fireflies.
"Beautiful," she whispered, harvesting his last thought.

Detective Chief Inspector Sarah Morgue stood in Greystone Psychiatric Hospital's abandoned surgery ward, studying the corpse's exposed brain. Third victim this month, same signature: hippocampus removed with surgical precision, the rest of the brain matter liquefied by some kind of chemical agent.
"The killer's extracting memories," Dr. Park, the neurologist, said nervously. "But why keep them conscious during the procedure?"
Sarah touched the vintage electroshock machine, still warm. "Fear enhances memory consolidation. The killer wants their final moments—pure, distilled terror."
Her phone buzzed. Another body, fresh. Ward B.
Racing through Greystone's labyrinthine corridors, Sarah found victim four still breathing, skull opened like a flower. Marcus Webb, a name she recognized—a memory researcher who'd been selling extracted memories on the black market. Digital consciousness, he called it.
"Please..." Webb gasped. "She said... she said she was police..."
Sarah knelt beside him, checking his pupils. "Who? Who said that?"
"You... it was you..."
Her partner, Detective Ryan Price, arrived as Webb flatlined. "Jesus, Sarah. He knew you?"
"We consulted on a case five years ago," she lied smoothly. "Memory modification ring."
But Price was already examining the scene, finding something Sarah had missed—or left—a neural storage device containing terabytes of extracted memories. He plugged it into his tablet.
Faces flooded the screen. Victims' last moments, their memories playing like snuff films. But there was more—memories of the killer, reflected in the victims' eyes. A woman in surgical scrubs. Familiar bone structure.
"Sarah," Price said slowly, "I need you to step back."
She did, pulling her service weapon. "You don't understand, Ryan."
"Then explain why Webb's neural scan shows you in his memories. Operating on him."
Sarah's mask slipped. "Have you ever watched your mother die of Alzheimer's? Watched her memories dissolve like sugar in rain? I'm preserving them. All of them."
"By killing people?"
"By saving what matters!" Her voice cracked. "Every victim was already destroying lives. Webb sold children's memories to pedophiles. Crane trafficked extracted memories from torture victims. I'm not killing innocents—I'm archiving monsters."
Price reached for his radio. Sarah shot him in the shoulder, the sound echoing through empty wards.
Running now, Sarah descended into Greystone's basement, where her real laboratory waited. Hundreds of brain tissue samples in preservation tanks, thousands of memory drives catalogued by date and victim. Her life's work—a library of human consciousness, stolen one scream at a time.
She heard SWAT teams entering above. Time for the final procedure.
Sarah connected the neural interface to her own skull, uploading five years of extracted memories directly into her hippocampus. The victims' final moments flooded her consciousness—their fear, their pain, their desperate pleas. She experienced every death from both sides now, killer and victim simultaneously.
"Dr. Morgue!" SWAT surrounded her. "Step away from the equipment!"
But Sarah was already gone, lost in a recursive loop of memories that weren't hers. She'd become her own victim, trapped forever in the moment of death, experiencing it from infinite perspectives.
They found her catatonic, tears streaming down her face, mumbling: "I remember everything. I remember everything. I remember everything."
The memory archive was destroyed, but fragments leaked online. Somewhere, someone was learning Sarah's techniques.
The cycle would continue.
