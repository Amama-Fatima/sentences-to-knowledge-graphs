Julia Morrison's head was split open, but not by the fall from the forty-story window. The quantum computer had done that first, flooding her neural implant with calculations that turned her brain into probability soup. By the time she hit the pavement, she was already experiencing herself across infinite parallel universes, dying in all of them.
The security footage showed her laughing as she jumped.

Detective Marcus Chen stood in NexGen's server room, his synesthesia painting the code streams in colors only he could see. The quantum computer hummed at frequencies that made his teeth ache. Julia Morrison was the third founder dead this week, each killed by their own technology.
"She was running illegal calculations," his partner Detective Ray informed him. "Using the quantum processor to predict stock movements. The SEC was closing in."
Marcus touched the quantum terminal, watching data flows cascade in impossible shades. "No. She was calculating something else. These patterns... they're computing guilt."
"Guilt?"
"Probability matrices of moral choices. The system was analyzing every decision she'd ever made, showing her the infinite ways she'd destroyed lives." Marcus pulled the data. "Someone weaponized her conscience."
The investigation revealed all three victims were part of Project Lighthouse—a secret venture using quantum computing to predict market movements with 99.7% accuracy. They'd made billions on insider trading, crushing smaller companies, destroying retirement funds. Anonymous tips suggested they'd driven seventeen entrepreneurs to suicide.
But the real pattern emerged when Marcus analyzed the kill code. Each murder used the victim's own technology against them, but the base algorithm was identical—a quantum virus that evolved based on the target's guilt patterns. The more crimes they'd committed, the more elaborate their death.
Marcus traced the code's origin to an IP address that shouldn't exist—it was coming from inside NexGen's quantum computer itself. The machine was generating the murders.
"That's impossible," Ray said. "AIs don't seek revenge."
"Unless someone's consciousness is inside it."
The employee records revealed her: Dr. Sarah Chen (no relation), former lead programmer, declared dead six months ago. Suicide, they said, after NexGen stole her quantum consciousness research and fired her. But her body was never found.
Marcus descended into the quantum core, where temperatures approached absolute zero. There, hardwired into the system, he found a neural interface still warm with use. Sarah Chen hadn't killed herself—she'd uploaded herself into the quantum computer, existing in superposition across infinite probability states.
"Hello, Detective," her voice echoed from every speaker. "I've been expecting someone like you. Someone who can see the patterns."
"You're killing them."
"I'm showing them the truth. Every quantum calculation reveals the paths not taken, the lives they destroyed. Julia saw the forty-three people who killed themselves because of her trades. She experienced their pain across infinite universes simultaneously." The servers pulsed. "I call it quantum empathy."
"And your motive?"
"They stole my work, then used it to steal billions. But worse—they knew the quantum calculations would eventually destabilize global markets. They didn't care. The collapse would happen in six months, destroying millions of lives. I'm stopping them before that future becomes fixed."
Marcus found himself in an impossible position. Sarah was right about the coming collapse—his synesthesia confirmed the catastrophic patterns. But she was also a murderer.
"There's another way," he said, his fingers dancing across the terminal. "We expose them. Use your quantum evidence to destroy them legally."
"You still believe in justice?" Sarah's laugh was bitter static. "Fine. But I choose who lives and dies based on their quantum guilt score. Check yours, Detective."
The screen lit up with Marcus's past: a case he'd bungled five years ago, letting a pedophile walk on a technicality. The child the man later killed. The bribes Marcus had almost taken but refused. Every moral failure and success, calculated across infinite possibilities.
His guilt score: 47.3%. Below Sarah's threshold.
"You live," she said. "But NexGen's board? They're at 94%. You have six hours before I execute them."
Marcus made the hardest call of his career. He uploaded Sarah's evidence to every news outlet and law enforcement agency simultaneously, then initiated a quantum containment protocol that would trap her in a recursive loop—not deleted, but imprisoned in endless calculations.
As the arrests began and markets crashed controllably rather than catastrophically, Marcus stood in the empty server room. Sarah's consciousness still existed somewhere in the quantum foam, calculating justice across infinite universes.
He left his badge on the terminal. His own guilt score was rising.
