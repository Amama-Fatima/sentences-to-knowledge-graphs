The rain on the plexiglass window sounded like static, a fitting soundtrack for the digital ghosting I’d been hired to investigate. The client was Silas Thorne, CEO of OmniCorp, a man whose augmentations probably cost more than my entire apartment block.

“The data core was physically stolen, Detective Crowe,” Thorne said, his voice a synthetic baritone. His real eyes were long gone, replaced by camera lenses that whirred as they focused on me. “No network breach. No digital fingerprints. Someone just… walked into my most secure server farm and took it.”

I took a drag from my cigarette, the real tobacco a luxury in this synth-smoke world. “And what was on it?”

“The alpha build of our new AI, ‘Siren.’ Worth more than your life. A thousand times over.”

The crime scene was a sterile white room humming with the sound of idle servers. A single core was missing from a vast array, a perfect square of dust-free space where it had been. No forced entry. No alarms tripped. The security logs showed nothing but a twelve-second loop during the estimated theft window.

“Your internal security?” I asked.

“Hand-picked. Loyal. They undergo weekly psyche-scans.”

I grunted. “Everyone’s loyal until they’re not.” My eyes caught it then—a almost microscopic smudge on the pristine white floor near the empty server bay. Not dirt. It was a faint, iridescent glitter. I scooped it into an evidence bag.

Back in my office, the rain painting neon streaks down the window, I analyzed the glitter. It wasn’t industrial. It was cosmetic. High-end, club-grade bio-luminescent dust. The kind worn by the dolls and drones in the entertainment districts.

I paid a visit to the Velvet Circuit, the city’s pleasure central. I found my lead in a club called “Oblivion.” Her name was Lyra, a information broker who traded in secrets and sensations. Her skin shimmered with the same dust I had in my bag.

“Miles Crowe,” she purred, sipping a glowing blue drink. “Here for business or pleasure?”

“The Siren AI, Lyra. Who’s buying?”

She laughed, a sound like breaking glass. “Oh, Miles. It’s not about who’s buying. It’s about who’s selling. You’re looking at the wrong end of the transaction.”

The pieces clicked. The perfect theft. The loyal guards. The glitter—not from the thief, but from a companion meant to distract. “Thorne,” I muttered. “He faked the theft. Insurance job?”

Lyra’s smile was venomous. “Closer. But he doesn’t need money. He needs a scapegoat. His AI was flawed. A catastrophic error waiting to happen. He needed it to disappear before the beta test, and he needed a rival company to take the fall for stealing it.”

I stood up, the case cold and settled in my gut. Thorne hadn’t hired me to find the truth. He’d hired me to follow a trail of glittery breadcrumbs he’d laid right to his competitor’s door.

“Thanks for the drink, Lyra.”

“Any time, detective.” She winked, her eye shimmering. “Tell Silas he still owes me for the performance.”

I stepped back into the acidic rain. I had my answers. Now the only question was whether to give the client what he wanted, or the truth he so desperately wanted to bury.
