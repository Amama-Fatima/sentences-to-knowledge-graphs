The diver's headlamp flickered across the submarine's hull, illuminating barnacles that looked like calcified screams. Inside the flooded torpedo room of the USS Leviathan, vacuum-sealed medical containers bobbed against the ceiling—each one worth a fortune, each one containing a human heart.
Twenty feet above, Marcus Webb checked his dive computer. Three minutes until the harbor patrol's shift change. His partner should have surfaced by now.
A cloud of blood bloomed in the water.

Detective Lieutenant Maya Patel rappelled down the rust-eaten ladder into Triton Base's Dock Seven, her marine biology background screaming warnings about the unnatural algae growth. The anonymous tip had been specific: midnight, the abandoned submarine pens, bring a dive team.
"Body's down there," Sergeant Rico pointed at the murky water. "But Maya, there's more. We found surgical equipment in the pump house."
Maya's throat tightened. Before joining the force, she'd studied marine parasites that hijacked their hosts' bodies. Now she hunted parasites of a different kind.
"Get me underwater," she ordered.
The dive revealed horrors: the USS Leviathan's hull had been cut open, its interior converted into a surgical suite. Organ transport containers floated everywhere, some still maintaining temperature. The dead diver—Marcus Webb, according to his tags—had been gutted with surgical precision.
Surfacing, Maya found Dr. Elizabeth Chen from the Coast Guard waiting. "Those containers? Chinese manufacture, but modified with military-grade cooling systems. Someone's running organs through your harbor."
"Using decommissioned subs as operating rooms," Maya muttered. "They're harvesting down here."
Her phone buzzed. Another body had surfaced near Pier 12—a homeless veteran named Tom Rodriguez, missing a kidney. Still alive, barely.
At the hospital, Rodriguez wheezed through morphine: "Pretty lady... said she'd pay five grand... just some blood work..."
Maya's investigation web expanded. The pretty lady—described by three other survivors—worked the homeless camps, recruiting "donors." The submarine base provided cover; its abandoned state meant no security, and the acoustic properties of submarine hulls masked screams.
Following chemical traces in the water, Maya's team found the real surgical site: the USS Mako, three pens over. Inside, they discovered something worse—a full medical team's worth of equipment and a ledger. The organs weren't just being harvested; they were being genetically modified using irradiated seawater, creating "universal" organs that wouldn't reject.
"Detective Patel?" A woman's voice echoed through the submarine pen.
Dr. Sarah Vance stepped from the shadows, hands raised. Maya recognized her from missing persons—a brilliant transplant surgeon who'd vanished two years ago after her daughter died waiting for a heart.
"I can explain—"
"You're harvesting people!"
"No!" Vance's eyes blazed. "I'm saving them. The poor, the forgotten—I give them money, take only what they can spare. The organs I modify save twenty times more lives than traditional transplants."
"And Marcus Webb?"
"He was stealing from us. Selling unmodified organs to Chinese brokers." Vance's face hardened. "He was the real parasite."
Maya heard movement. Too late, she realized Vance wasn't alone. Captain Brooks from Harbor Patrol emerged, weapon drawn. The red herring had been the homeless victims—the real conspiracy went higher.
"Sorry, Patel. Do you know what my daughter needs? Gene therapy. Expensive gene therapy."
The confrontation erupted in the submarine's tight quarters. Maya's diving experience saved her—she rolled into the flooded torpedo tube, using her regulator to breathe while Brooks fired blindly into the water. She surfaced behind him, her marine biology knowledge having taught her how predators use murky water.
The arrest was violent, wet, and satisfying.
Later, processing evidence, Maya found the larger horror: seventeen submarine bases nationwide showed similar activity patterns. Triton was just one node in a vast network, harvesting society's forgotten to supply those who could pay.
She stared at the modified organs, still viable, still capable of saving lives. Somewhere, people were dying on waiting lists. Somewhere else, the homeless were being butchered.
The ocean had taught her that nature was amoral, but humans were supposed to be better. Tonight, she wasn't sure.
