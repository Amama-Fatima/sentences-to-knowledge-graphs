The air in the "Chromatica Modern" gallery was colder than the investors' smiles. Detective Kaito Tanaka hated places like this—all stark white walls and the faint, cloying scent of champagne and hypocrisy. He stood before a massive canvas, a swirl of violent reds and calming blues titled "Azure Rage #7." To him, it looked like a toddler’s tantrum, but the placard listed its value at $250,000.

"Another one," said his partner, Detective Miller, joining him. Miller was chewing gum, a vulgar act in the sacred gallery space. "The curator is having a meltdown in his office that's more dramatic than this painting."

The curator, a man named Alistair Finch, was indeed a wreck. His hands fluttered like injured birds. "It's a perfect copy! The brushwork, the viscosity of the paint... but it's not hers. The signature is a fraction of a millimeter off. The real one was here Tuesday during our private viewing."

"Who has access?" Kaito asked, his voice calm, a counterpoint to Finch's panic.

"The usual! Myself, my head of security, and our senior art handler, Ben. We are the only three with keys to the climate-controlled storage vault. The security system logs show no breaches. It's impossible!"

Kaito left Miller to calm Finch and went to find the art handler, Ben. He discovered him not in a pristine office, but in the back loading dock, smoking a cigarette with a shaking hand. He was young, with paint under his nails and a weary look in his eyes.

"You okay, Ben?" Kaito asked, leaning against the doorframe.

Ben jumped. "Yeah. Just... this is bad. Mr. Finch, he'll blame me. He always does."

"Did you move the painting?"

"Of course. Tuesday, after the viewing, I personally de-installed it and put it in the vault. I logged it. Security cam in the vault corridor will show me wheeling it in. It wasn't touched until this morning when we went to crate it for transport to the buyer." He took a drag. "It's spooky. Like a ghost swapped it."

Kaito’s phone buzzed. It was Miller: "Security footage is clean. No one went near the vault after Ben stored it. This guy's good."

Too good. Kaito walked back inside, his eyes scanning not the art, but the environment. The pristine white floors, the subtle vents for the climate control. His eyes caught a tiny, almost invisible smudge on the floor near the vault door—not dirt, but a faint, powdery blue residue. He knelt, dabbing it with his finger. It was chalky, like pastel.

He followed the faint, intermittent trail. It didn’t lead to the front door or the offices. It led to a janitor's closet. Inside, beside mops and buckets, was a ventilation grate. One screw was shiny and new amongst four old, dusty ones.

"Miller," Kaito said into his radio. "Get the building schematics. Now." He didn't need to wait for the answer. The forger hadn't come through the door. They’d come through the walls. The "impossible" theft was just a matter of knowing the building better than the owner did.

He found Alistair Finch back in his office, now sipping water and looking relieved that the police were someone else's problem. Kaito held up his dust-smudged finger.

"You said only three keys. Who else has access to the building's architectural plans? The original blueprints?"

Finch paled. "Well... my business partner, Eleanor Vance. But she's been on vacation for two weeks! She wouldn't—"

"Where does she live?" Kaito interrupted.

"Just a few blocks away. The penthouses overlooking the park. But why?"

"Because the real 'Azure Rage #7' is probably hanging in her living room right now," Kaito said. "She knew the security system. She knew the vents. She had a copy made and then swapped them during the chaos of the private viewing, not after. She used the old service ducts, leaving a trace of her pastel sketches on the way. She’s not just your partner, Mr. Finch. She's your competition."
