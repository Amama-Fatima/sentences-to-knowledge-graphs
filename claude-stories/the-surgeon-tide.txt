Detective Rosa Chen pulled her coat tighter as she navigated the cobblestone streets of Port Grimm. The fog rolled in thick from the harbor, muffling the sound of her footsteps and the distant cry of gulls. The gas lamps cast weak circles of light, barely penetrating the gloom that seemed permanently settled over this Victorian relic of a town.
The body had been found at dawn by a fisherman—a young man, expertly carved open and missing several organs. The precision of the cuts suggested medical training, but the callousness suggested something far worse than any legitimate surgery.
"Detective Chen?" Dr. Elias Blackwood emerged from the shadows near the morgue, his tall frame draped in a dark overcoat. As the town's chief medical examiner, he cut an imposing figure with his silver beard and piercing gray eyes. "I've completed the preliminary examination."
"What can you tell me?"
"The victim is Jonathan Hayes, twenty-two, a dock worker. The extractions were performed with surgical precision—kidney, liver, corneas, heart. All removed within hours of death."
Rosa studied the fog-shrouded street. "Any medical facilities in town with that capability?"
"The old Mercy General Hospital closed five years ago, but the equipment remains. Dr. Miranda Ashworth runs a small clinic on Harbour Street, though she lacks surgical facilities. There's also..." He paused. "Well, there are rumors of Dr. Cornelius Thorne."
"Thorne?"
"A disgraced surgeon who supposedly practices in the abandoned sections of the old hospital. The townspeople whisper about him, but no one admits to seeing him."
Rosa made her way to Dr. Ashworth's clinic, a modest building squeezed between a clockmaker's shop and a tea house. Inside, she found a middle-aged woman with tired eyes treating a child's scraped knee.
"Dr. Ashworth? Detective Chen. I'm investigating Jonathan Hayes' death."
The doctor's hands stilled. "Poor Jonathan. Such a tragedy."
"Did you know him well?"
"He came in occasionally. Minor injuries from dock work. Always worried about medical bills—said he couldn't afford proper care if something serious happened."
"Anyone ever approach him about... alternative ways to pay for medical treatment?"
Dr. Ashworth's face darkened. "There have been rumors. People desperate for money, being offered cash for... donations. I've tried to warn patients, but when someone's facing poverty or their family needs expensive treatment..."
"Where would these operations take place?"
"Detective, I can't—"
"Dr. Ashworth, someone is butchering people in your town."
She sighed deeply. "The old Mercy General. I've seen lights there at night, heard whispers about a doctor who can cure anything for the right price. But it's not Cornelius Thorne."
"Then who?"
"I think... I think it might be someone we all trust."
That evening, Rosa returned to the abandoned hospital. The fog was so thick she could barely see her hand in front of her face. Inside, she followed a faint light to the old surgical wing.
She found Dr. Blackwood in scrubs, preparing surgical instruments beside an operating table where a terrified young woman was strapped down.
"Detective Chen." His voice remained calm. "I was wondering when you'd piece it together."
"The medical examiner investigating his own crimes. Convenient."
"Supply and demand, Detective. Wealthy patients in the city need organs. Poor people here need money. I simply facilitate the transaction."
"By murdering them."
"The donors are compensated fairly before the procedures. If they occasionally don't survive the extraction process, well, that's an acceptable risk in any surgery."
Rosa drew her weapon. "Step away from the table."
Blackwood smiled coldly, pulling a scalpel. "The fog is very thick tonight, Detective. Accidents happen in the fog. People disappear."
"Not tonight, Doctor."
As Rosa handcuffed the disgraced medical examiner, the fog began to lift slightly. The young woman on the table would live, and Port Grimm's nightmare was over. But Rosa knew the Victorian shadows of this town would always harbor dark secrets, waiting for the next fog to roll in.
