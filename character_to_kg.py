The first victim collapsed during the Tuesday morning board meeting.
Dr. Amanda Cross, Zenith Pharmaceuticals' lead researcher, had been mid-sentence explaining their breakthrough Alzheimer's drug when she suddenly clutched her throat and fell forward onto the conference table.

By Friday, two more researchers were dead, and Detective Raj Patel found himself navigating the sterile corridors of one of Silicon Valley's most secretive biotech companies.
